# Introduction

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Frame 5.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Welcome to **Flare**, a Minecraft Fabric modpack designed to enhance your gaming experience with improved performance, a refined interface, and fixes for common UI issues. Flare is created to be an excellent alternative for low-end devices and mobile users, particularly those using **PojavLauncher**, an unofficial Minecraft launcher for mobile devices.

While we donâ€™t aim to compete directly with popular clients like **Lunar Client**, **Feather Client**, or **Labymod**, Flare is a lightweight option that brings a polished, modern look to Minecraft, especially for players on less powerful devices.\
